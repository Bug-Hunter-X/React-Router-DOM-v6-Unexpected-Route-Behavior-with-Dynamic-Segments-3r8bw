# React Router DOM v6 Unexpected Route Behavior with Dynamic Segments

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router DOM v6 when navigating between routes with dynamic segments. The issue seems to be related to how route parameters are handled, particularly in nested routes.

## Problem

The application uses nested routes and dynamic segments, which result in unpredictable behavior when transitioning between routes. The exact circumstances are complex, but involve specific interactions between the routing configuration and parameters.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`
4. Navigate to the different routes and observe unexpected transitions or rendering behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the route definitions or refactoring the components involved to ensure the routes work correctly under all conditions.

## Additional Information

This issue is highly specific to the particular nesting and parameter configurations shown in the code.

Please note that the exact causes and solutions can vary depending on the structure of the application's routes and components.
